## Project Overview

* **IITB-CPU** is a teaching-oriented 16-bit processor with 8 general-purpose registers.
* Follows a custom **instruction set architecture (ISA)**.
* Implements **point-to-point communication**.
* Written entirely in **VHDL** for FPGA-based simulation/synthesis.

## 📁 Repository Structure

* `src/` – VHDL source files  
* `testbench/` – Testbenches for simulation  
* `docs/` – Instruction set and architecture details
